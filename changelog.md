---

<a name="20240222"/>Build 20240222

__NOTE:__ This build has moved the probe input to the ioPorts pool of inputs and will be allocated from it when configured.  
The change is major and _potentially dangerous_, it may damage your probe, so please _verify correct operation_ after installing this build.  
There were basically two reasons for doing this, one is to free the input for general use if not needed and another is to be able to add advanced
probe protection support, via plugin code, for probe inputs that has interrupt capability.

Core:

* Fix for STM32F4xx [issue #161](https://github.com/grblHAL/STM32F4xx/issues/161), Ethernet connection unresponsive if USB port not powered.

* Enhanced ioPorts interface: New debounce option for input pins that are interrupt capable, currently only possible to enable via plugin code - later to be made available via a $-setting.  
Added some wrapper functions for simpler plugin code++


* Added simple task scheduler to the core, allows interrupt routines to dispatch jobs to the foreground process, delayed tasks and repeating tasks attached to the 1 ms system timer.  
Some drivers and plugins now uses the scheduler for input pin debouncing, regular polling etc. The core uses it for stepper disabling and sleep monitoring.

Drivers:

* Most: updated to support the enhanced ioPorts interface and using the new task scheduler for debouncing etc.
  Moved probe and safety door inputs to ioPorts pin pool, if not assigned at compile time they will be free to use by M66 or plugin code.   
  Many board maps has been updated to take advantage of the new ioPorts capabilities. PLease report anny irregularities as I do not have access to all the boards for testing.

* ESP32: MKS Tinybee v1.0 map changed to use MT_DET \(pin 35\) for motor 3 limit input \(e.g. auto squared Y\) if probe input is not enabled. Ref. [issue #93}(https://github.com/grblHAL/ESP32/issues/93#issuecomment-1917467402).

Plugins:

* Some: updated to use the new task scheduler for polling etc.

* Networking: WizNet driver code updated to use the new task scheduler for interrupt handling, resulting in faster/smoother operation.

* WebUI: a bit of code "hardening", reduced memory requirement for some of the larger generated messages.

---

<a name="20240109"/>Build 20240109

Core:

* Fix for issue #426, decreasing the `$30` setting value \(max spindle RPM\) causes incorrect PWM output.

* Implemented handling of _single block_, _block delete_ and _optional stop disable_ control signal events.  
Added help for `$S` \(single block\), `$B` \(block delete\) and `$O` \(optional stop disable\) commands that can be used
to toggle the functionality when the corresponding switch inputs are not available.

* Added [optional HAL entry point](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/structrgb__ptr__t.html) for outputting WRGB values to lights such as neopixels. The WRGB API may be extended later.

* Improved $-commands registration to make it easier to add help text and keep it in sync. Added missing help text for some core commands.  
Tip: send `$help commands` to output command help.

Drivers:

* ESP32: moved build configuration from [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/grblHAL/ESP32/blob/master/main/CMakeLists.txt) to
[my_machine.h](https://github.com/grblHAL/ESP32/blob/master/main/my_machine.h), mainly for reducing build time in the Web Builder.  
More changes for ESP32-S3 compatibility, still work in progress but getting closer.

---

<a name="20231229"/>Build 20231229

Core:

* Fixed regression that prevented builds with compatibiliy level set > 1.

* Added `[SIGNALS:xxx]` element to the `$I` output, `xxx` uses the same letters as the `Pn:`
element in the [real time report](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Report-extensions#realtime-report) and list all available from the controller except limits inputs.

Drivers:

* Most: added new configuration options in _my_machine.h_ for assigning optional signals to aux input ports. These are:
1. `SAFETY_DOOR_ENABLE` - bound to aux port in the map file for backwards comaptibility.
2. `MOTOR_FAULT_ENABLE` - bound to aux port in the map file since a single MCU input might be routed to several external inputs.
3. `MOTOR_WARNING_ENABLE` - bound to aux port in the map file since a single MCU input might be routed to several external inputs.
4. `PROBE_DISCONNECT_ENABLE` - assigned from unused ports.
5. `STOP_DISABLE_ENABLE` - assigned from unused ports.
6. `BLOCK_DELETE_ENABLE` - assigned from unused ports.
7. `SINGLE_BLOCK_ENABLE` - assigned from unused ports.
8. `LIMITS_OVERRIDE_ENABLE` - assigned from unused ports. Always active low.

If too many inputs are enabled assignment will fail silently for those who cannot be bound.  
__NOTE:__ core functionality for some of these inputs might change after user input!  
Tip: use the `$pins` command to output the mapping.

* ESP32: moved board maps and board specific code to separate folder.

Added new optional setting, `$535`, for configuring WizNet interface MAC address.
This _must_ be set to all but one when more than one WizNet controller is added to the network.  
Tip: grab a MAC address from an unused device such as a router.  
__NOTE:__ Network settings for controllers having a WizNet interface will be reset to default on upgrade.

---

<a name="20231210"/>Build 20231210

Core:

* Spindle handling refactoring for improved management and configuration of multiple spindles.  
__NOTE:__ this is a relatively large change and may have introduced bugs and/or unintended side-effects. Please report any issues!

* Added setting `$519` for binding spindle encoder to given spindle in multi spindle configurations.

* Added machine readable spindle enumeration report, `$SPINDLESH`.

* Increased _default_ value for setting `$398` \(number of planner blocs\) from 35 to 100 for faster laser engraving.
Ref. [this discussion](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/discussions/402).  
__NOTE:__ the `$398` setting value will _not_ change on an upgrade!  
__NOTE:__ STM32F103 builds for the 128K flash variants does not have enough free RAM and will keep 35 as the default value.

* Increased allowed number of decimal places from 3 to 5 for `$10x` stepper step/mm settings.
Ref. [ioSender issue 346](https://github.com/terjeio/ioSender/issues/346).  

* Added setting `$650` for filing system options. Ref. [issue 397](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/issues/397).   
Currently the following bits are available \(depending on the configuration\):  
0 - Auto mount SD card on startup \(1\).  
1 - Do not add littlefs files when listing the root directory \(2\).

* Added build option for [lathe UVW mode](https://www.cnctrainingcentre.com/haas-turn/u-and-w-on-a-cnc-lathe-incremental-programming/).
Ref [this discussion](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/discussions/398).  
When enabled `UVW` words can be used to command relative moves for `XYZ` without switching to relative mode with `G91`. `U` -> `X`, `V` -> `Y`, `W` -> `Z`.  
__NOTE:__ This permanently sets lathe mode and disables the `$32` mode setting.

For developers: 

* There are signature changes to some spindle, ioports enumeration and VFS filing system mount functions.

* Added events to allow plugin code to handle tool table data, possibly stored on a SD card. Ref. [this discussion](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/discussions/392).

Drivers:

* Most: updated for refactored spindle handling and configuration.

* ESP32: fix for spindle at speed failure. Ref. [ioSender issue 345](https://github.com/terjeio/ioSender/issues/345).

* STM32F7xx: fix to reduce stepper current surge on startup. Ref. [issue 400](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/issues/400).

* iMRX1062: fix for hardfault when enabling aux input IRQ early in startup sequence.  Ref. [issue 395](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/issues/395).

Plugins:

* Spindle: updated for core changes. Added several spindles:  
_Nowforever VFD._ \(untested\).  
_Stepper spindle._ This claims the stepper driver from the last configured axis.  
_PWM clone._ This clones the default driver implemented PWM spindle and changes it to use the direction signal for on/off control.  
Settings `$730`, `$731` and `$734` - `$736` will be used to configure the clone. These has the same function as the `$30` - `$36` counterparts.  
The driver spindle is suitable for controlling a laser when `$32` = `1` and the clone is suitable for controlling a spindle motor.  
Switching between the spindles is typically done with `M104Q<n>` where `<n>` is the spindle number.  
_Basic spindle._ Needs and claims 1 or 2 auxillary digital output ports depending on the configuration.  
_Additional PWM spindle._ Needs and claims 1 or 2 auxillary digital output ports and one analog PWM capable port.  

* Motors: fixed default Trinamic motor current - was incorrectly set to 0, changed to 500 mA RMS. Ref. [issue 400](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/issues/400).

* Various: updated for core call signature changes.

<a name="20230905"/>Build 20230905

Core:

* The method for constraining continuous multi-axis jogs \(XYZ\) \(when enabled by `$40=1`\) will now use clipping of the motion vector to the work envelope instead of limiting the target to min/max separately for each axis.
The signature of the new core handler introduced in build 20230903 for constraining jog motions has been changed to accomodate this.

* Delta robot kinematics tuning, added new setting for max allowed arm angle. Constraining jog movements to the full work envelope may now work \(I do not have a machine to test with\).
Still work in progress.

Drivers:

ESP32: fix for Modbus RTU serial port board definitions.

STM32F4xx: removed unused code.
 
---

<a name="20230903"/>Build 20230903

Core:

* Changed handling of homing inputs from limit switches. Some drivers will now only disable hard limits (if enabled) for axes that are homing, this includes max/min limit switches.
If max limit switches are available for the board/configuration these will be picked for homing in the positive direction and min switches in the negative direction.
The "unused" limit switches may have hard limits still enabled - depending on the driver.  
__NOTE:__ I plan to add full support for all drivers to keep hard limits enabled for limit switches that are not used for the running homing cycle, this may take some time though as the changes has to be verified.  
__NOTE:__ !! This is a __potentiallly dangerous change___, be careful when homing the machine for the first time after installing/upgrading.

* HAL entry points and core handlers/events has been added and some have changed signatures in order to better support kinematics implementations.

* More work on delta kinematics: new and changed settings, some improved functionality. Still in progress.

Drivers:

* Most: updated for HAL/core event signature changes.

* STM32F4xx: "hardened" Trinamic soft UART code to improve reliability. Added fans plugin.

Plugins:

* Motors: fixed bug that would cause a hard fault if the X driver is not configured as Trinamic when others are. Updated for core event signature change.

* Plasma: relaxed I/O requirements, will now start if up/down signals or arc voltage input is available. Still work in progress.

* SD card: added option for named pallet shuttle macro to be called on M60.

---

<a name="20230610"/>Build 20230610

Core:

* Added virtual Modbus API. Some internal settings handling improvements.

Drivers:

* iMXRT1062, STM32F7xx and RP2040: added Modbus TCP network support.

* STM32F1xx: rerouted _Reset_ signal as _Emergency stop_ per default. Can be overridden in _my_machine.h_ or by setting `COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL` > 1.

* STM32F4xx, ESP32, SAM3X8E and MSP432P401R: minor changes to handle new location of Modbus API.

Plugins:

* Spindle: refactored and renamed Modbus RTU code as a driver implementation for the core Modbus API.

* Networking: added Modbus TCP driver for core Modbus API with support for up to 8 devices. Default is four.  
Added WIZNet support for Modbus TCP.  
Modbus TCP is enabled by bit 2 in the `MODBUS_ENABLE` symbol in _my_machine.h_: `#define MOBUS_ENABLE 4`. This can be added to the previous define values for enabling Modbus RTU with or without RS 485 direction signal support.  
__NOTE:__ The new core API only supports the Modbus RTU protocol, this will be translated to/from Modbus TCP by the driver implementation.  
User code _can_ bypass the core API and transmit Modbus TCP messages directly if it wants/needs to.  
__NOTE:__ VFD spindle Modbus communication will be routed to Modbus TCP if the VFD device id \(unit id\) matches the Modbus TCP device id.  
For now this is untested and may lock up the controller since the networking stack comes up too late to avoid power up selftest \(POS\) failure.
To be addressed in a later revision if someone with a Modbus TCP capable spindle is willing to test.

* Motors and encoder: updated for core setting handling improvements.

Plugins:

* SD Card, macro plugin: implemented automatic hook to tool change functions when tool change macros are found in the root mount directory.  
Tool change macro: _tc.macro_, called on `M6`. \(required\).  
Tool select macro: _ts.macro_, called on `T`. \(optional\).  
__NOTE:__ This functionality needs to be extensively tested by users having access to ATC hardware! [Discuss here](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/discussions/309).

* Improved stream handling for native USB streams when another stream claims/releases full control.
Depending on the driver some output, such as real-time reports, will now be sent to the USB stream if it is connected to a client \(detected by DTR signal asserted\).
When a pendant is in control \(via the MPG interface\) the USB interface will no longer block transmission if it is the primary interface and no client is connected.

Drivers:

* iMXRT1061, RP2040, all STM32 drivers, SAM3X8E and LPC176x: added DTR signal state detection and handling for native USB streams.

```
$9: PWM Spindle as bitfield where setting bit 0 enables the rest:
    0 - Enable (1)
    1 - RPM controls spindle enable signal (2)
```
Bit 1 in this setting replaces setting `$7`, bit 0 controls the PWM output.  
__NOTE:__ M3 and M4 with S0 will now set the spindle enable output if `$9` is `1`. Ref [issue #156](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/issues/156).  
__NOTE:__ the change is not backwards compatible with current 3rd party drivers, these has to be updated to match changes in the core.


Drivers:

* All: Updated for core changes related to the new `$9` setting.

* ESP32: Prepared driver for ethernet interface.

---

20220625:

---

20220325:

Core:

* Changed spindle handling to allow dynamic spindle registration and support for multiple spindles selectable at run-time.  
If more than one spindle is to be made available [grbl/config.h](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/blob/master/config.h) has to be edited and the symbol `N_SPINDLE` has to be increased from the default value of 1 to the number of spindles to allow \(currently max 8\).  
When more than one spindle is registered setting `$395` becomes available for specifying the spindle to enable at startup. Use `$$=395` to output a list of available spindles and the corresponding spindle id to use for configuration.  
__NOTE:__ Using `$32` for switching between a PWM spindle and a VFD spindle is no longer supported, either use `$395` or `M104P0` to select the PWM spindle, `M104P1` to select the configured VFD spindle.
Note that laser mode \(`$32=1`\) will be disabled if the active spindle is not a PWM spindle.   
__NOTE:__ the change is not backwards compatible with current 3rd party drivers, these has to be updated to match the changed core.

Plugins:

* The PPI and spindle plugins has been updated for the new spindle handling. 

Drivers:

* All: updated for the new spindle handling.  
__NOTE:__ I have only done limited testing of the changes, please report any problems!

* Corrections for Arduino builds, a few minor bug fixes.

---

Build 20211015:

Core:
* Improved `grbl.on_probe_fixture` event signature by adding pointer to the pending tool when fired when M6 is executing \(NULL if not\) and a flag indicating that the current XY-position is within 5mm of G59.3.
* A few minor fixes.

Plugins:
* I2C keypad: Switch to metric mode when jogging.
* WebUI: added option to store read-only webui files in flash.

Templates:
* Updated the [probe select](https://github.com/grblHAL/Templates/blob/master/my_plugin/probe%20select/my_plugin.c) example for the `grbl.on_probe_fixture` signature change and added an optional mode select parameter to M401.

---

Build 20211010:

Core:
* Added enum and associated get function for system defined named parameters.
* Added events (function pointers) for tool change mode 2 and 3 events \(can be used to switch between probes\) and for publishing active homing feedrate.

Drivers:
* Improved stream support in many drivers by adding support for _write_n_ characters. This is mainly used for outputting human readable settings descriptions.
* Added TMC2209 UART support to the STM32F407 based BTT SKR 2.0 board. By @fitch22

Plugins:
* Added support for reading files from flash based storage to http daemon support code.  
  If a file is not found in the SD-card _www_ folder an attempt will be made to locate in in flash.  
  Added `WEBUI_INFLASH` option to _my_machine.h_ for storing WebUI files \(_index.html.gz_ and _favicon.ico_\) in flash.  
  Note that if these files are found in the SD card _www_ folder they will be used instead.
* Improved Trinamic driver support both generally and for the TMC2209 silent stepstick.  
  The default feedrate for switching to SpreadCycle mode has been changed to 0 \(never switch\), use [M913](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugins_motor) to set it or set the default value in [trinamic.h](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugins_motor/blob/master/trinamic.h) by changing the `PWM_THRESHOLD_VELOCITY` symbol.  
  This is still work in progress, sensorless homing is most problematic and is likely to require tuning of several parameters. E.g. the slow approach feed rate should not be too slow - the default 25 mm/min certainly seems to be.

---

Build 20210928:

Core:
* Changed safety door/parking handling to be compliant with legacy Grbl - now a cycle start command has to be issued to resume after the door is closed.
* Added `$384` setting for controlling G92 offset persistence, set to `1` to disable persistence across a reboot, `0` to enable. Only available if [compatibility level](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Compatibility-level) is < 2, default value is `0`.
* Improved `$help` command output and handling, added description to `$$=<n>` output.
* Moved the optional tool table in non-volatile storage \(typically EEPROM\) to above the core area. This allows a larger number of tools \(max. 16\) to be defined.  
__NOTE:__ If you have tool table support enabled before upgrading the current table will be lost and possibly also all other settings. Backup and restore!
* Added gcode parameter support. All [NIST RS274NGC version 3](https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-rs274ngc-interpreter-version-3) parameters (see section 3.2.1) and most [LinuxCNC](http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/overview.html#_parameters) parameters are supported.  
  The `$#=<n>` or `$#=<name>` commands can be used to output a parameter value. Replace `<n>` with a parameter number, `<name>` with a parameter name.  
__NOTE 1:__ Named parameters and parameters in the range 1 to 5160 are volatile and will not persist across a reboot.  
__NOTE 2:__ Space for the volatile parameters is allocated at run-time, available memory \(heap\) sets a limit to how many can be set.  
__NOTE 3:__ Maximum name length is 20 characters, maximum number of parameters that can be set in a block \(line\) is 10.
* Added gcode [expression](http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/overview.html#gcode:expressions) support. This has to be enabled in [grbl/config.h](./config.h) by uncommenting `//#define NGC_EXPRESSIONS_ENABLE 1`. _Experimental_.  
__NOTE:__ Processors with limited memory may not compile with this enabled.

Drivers & plugins:

* Added [WebUI plugin](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_WebUI) support for some networking capable boards.
* Updated some drivers for internal API changes. Some minor bug fixes.

---

Build 20210907:

Core:
* Improved HAL/core stream handling for plugin issued [realtime commands](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/structgrbl__t.html#a2ff011529d0a7809a44c8609490e0306).
* Some minor bug fixes and added rudimentary settings validations relevant when switching board map files.

Drivers & plugins:
* Fixed regression in encoder plugin.
* Updated all drivers and relevant plugins for HAL/core API changes.
* Added PWM inversion option to [iMXRT1062 driver](https://github.com/grblHAL/iMXRT1062).
* Significantly improved [STM32F7xx driver](https://github.com/grblHAL/STM32F7xx), still work in progress.

---

Build 20210819:

Core:
* Added `$376` setting for designating ABC-axes individually as rotational.  
__NOTE:__ This setting is only available when N_AXIS is > 3 and will force a settings reset on an upgrade for such configurations. Backup and restore settings when upgrading!  
Scaling from inches to mm is disabled for axes designated as rotational, no other processing takes place.
* Added `$ESG` and `$ESH` system commands for outputting current setting definitions in [Grbl csv-format](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/tree/master/doc/csv) and grblHAL tab-format respectively.
Only settings valid in the active configuration will be outputted, driver and plugin specific settings will be added as well - even from well behaved third party code.
* Added setting descriptions to most core/driver/plugin settings. Third party drivers and plugins may also add descriptions to any settings implementented.  
NOTE: Drivers for processors with limited flash may not have the descriptions compiled in.
* Added `$SED=<n>`  for outputting a description for setting `<n>` (if available), e.g. issue `$SED=14` to get a description for `$14`. The description is formatted for sender use.

Drivers & plugins:
* Cleaned up/simplified many pin mapping files, mostly by moving pin to bit transforms to a common preprocessor file.
* Some general driver and plugin improvements, e.g. more flexible spindle PWM to pin mappings for STM32F4xx and STM32F7xx drivers.

---

Build 20210803:

Core:
* Added optional HAL entry point for stepper motor enumeration (axis vs. motor id). Used by motors plugin.
* Improved optional driver support files.

Drivers & plugins:
* Added F103RC support and a board map for the BTT SKR MINI E3 V2.0 to the STMF1xx driver.
* Added tentative plasma plugin support to the SAM3X8E \(Arduino Due\) driver.
* Updated motors plugin to match updated [Trinamic library](https://github.com/terjeio/Trinamic-library), added support for TMC2209++.
* Some minor bug fixes and improvements.

---

Build 20210726:

Core:
* Added encapsulation in stream handlers for realtime processing. This allows more flexible use of additional streams.
* Added optional debug stream to the HAL. Currently only used by the iMXRT1062 driver.
* Position will now be recalculated on steps/mm setting changes.
* Limited final `$TPW` retract on tool changes to Z home to avoid triggering Z-limit.
* Moved some common driver code snippets to the core to avoid duplication.

Drivers & plugins:
* Updated all for new stream encapsulation.
* Added option to use UART input for I2C keypad plugin. Added fan toggle support.
* Fixed some bugs and regressions.
* Added support for ganged/autosquared axes to RP2040 driver.

---

Build 20210707:

Core:
* Added realtime command `0x8A` for toggling fan 0 on/off. Requires the Fans plugin.
* Moved a bit of code to aid documentation structure.
* Added option for plugins to add pin description for claimed pins to `$pins` report.
* Simplified API for user added M-codes, backwards compatibility retained for now.

Drivers:
* Updated a number of drivers for new style pin handling (allows `$pins` report and simpler pin mapping files).
* Updated and verified driver for RP2040, mainly to support the PicoCNC board.
* Added/improved interrupt support for auxiliary inputs for both plugin code (via API) and for `M66`.
* Bug fixes.

Build 20210626:
* Standardized handling of motors for ABC- and ganged/squared axes, configuration moved to _my_machine.h_.  
First number of motors required is calculated, then ABC axes are added from bottom up and then ganged/squared axes from top down.  
E.g if the board map supports six motors then the following allocations will be made:  
A-axis and auto-squared Y axis: A-axis -> motor 4 and second Y-axis -> motor 5. Motor 6 pins may then be assigned to auxiliary I/O.  
A-axis, B-axis and ganged X-axis: A-axis -> motor 4 and, B-axis -> motor 5 and second X-axis -> motor 6. Motor 6 limit pin\(s\) if available may be assigned to auxiliary I/O.  
Auto-squared X and Y-axis: second X-axis -> motor 4 and second Y-axis -> motor 5. Motor 6 pins may then be assigned to auxiliary I/O.  
etc...  
__IMPORTANT:__ For those who have used auto-squared/ganged axes with previous builds be sure to check that the motors allocated matches the current wiring.
Tip: use the `$pins` system command to list the pin allocations when checking. Rewire as necessary. 
* Added ganged axis/auto-squaring support to some board maps for the [LPC176x](https://github.com/grblHAL/LPC176x) driver.
* Expanded on HAL entry points for stream communication and added [initial documentation](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/hal_8h.html) for the HAL and parts of the core.
* Encapsulated UART/USB CDC code for many drivers, for most only the init function is now available for direct access from the outside. Simplified main driver code and plugins using streams.  
__NOTE:__ For driver developers: `hal.stream.get_rx_buffer_available` has been renamed to `hal.stream.get_rx_buffer_free` as it was ambiguous \(free space vs. available characters\).
* Added preview version of [Bluetooth plugin](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugins_Bluetooth/) - allows auto configuration and auto stream switching for drivers/boards that supports it.
* Added number of auxiliary I/O ports available to `$I` command response.
* Added value read from last `M66` to the first real-time report following the read. The element `|In:<value>` is used for the report. If the value reported is `-1` the read failed.

---

Build 20210608:
* Fixes for `$70` setting handling, networking services. Only compile time enabled services \(or protocols\) can now be configured.

---

Build 20210604:
* Added some HAL entry points and properties, shared file for mapped step and dir output.
* Added `$pins` system command, for listing current pin assignments. Work in progress, only supported by a couple of drivers. For now only plain GPIO pins are listed.
* Some minor bugs fixed. 

---

Build 20210515:

* Fixed G43 "bug" by changing to LinuxCNC specification. NIST specification is ambiguous.
* Added acceleration override handling, to be used by OpenPNP plugin M-code.

---

Build 20210505:

* Some bug fixes: relative canned cycles repeat error, comment handling...
* Check mode changes to allow use with SD card streaming.
* Internal buffer changes for reducing RAM footprint. Some HAL extensions.

---

Build 20210314:

* Added support for tool change protocol to networking protocols using shared stream buffer.
* Added `$S` system command for toggling single step mode, when enabled cycle start has to be issued after each block.
* Some bug fixes.

---

Build 20210207:

* Added `#define BOARD_MY_MACHINE` option in _my_machine.h_ for building using _my_machine-map.c_, this for simpler handling of user defined pin mappings.  
_my_machine-map.c_ is __*not*__ part of the distributed source and must by added to the project by the user before enabled, typically by copying an existing map file.
* Added HAL layer on top of Trinamic driver low-level code. Unified Triniamic plugins into single plugin.  
This is still work in progress, testers wanted.
* Added core support for up to four limit switches per axis.  
Added `$LEV` command for outputting report containing which limit or control switch(es) caused the last event.  
Report format:  
`[LASTEVENTS:<control signals>,<min>,<max>,<min2>,<max2)]`  
Where `<control signals>` field may contain controls signal letters (`H`, `S` etc.) and the rest axis letters for the corresponding limit switches inputs.
* More settings subsystem changes and refactored $-system commands parser.  
There are some API changes related to this that may affect user defined plugins.
* Added $7 setting for option "Spindle off with zero speed".
* Added `|FW:grblHAL` element to full real-time report requested by sending `0x87`. 
* Simplified settings handling.
* No longer sends any messages to networking streams on connect.
* Added [driver](drivers/STM32F3xx) for STM32F303 based Blackpills.
* Updated support for Trinamic TMC5160 drivers, currently for the SKR 1.x boards \(LPC176x driver\) - testing i progress.
* Initial support for Trinamic TMC5160 drivers added, currently for the SKR 1.x boards \(LPC176x driver\) - not yet tested.
* Added handling for motor fault signal to the core, similar to E-stop handling. Added new alarm and error code for this.
* Changed to clear homed status on a soft reset only if machine was in motion. Added setting flag for always keeping homed status on soft reset to `$22` setting.  
__NOTE:__ This change is experimental and might be changed or reverted. Please report any problems related to this.
* Updated gcode parser \(grbl/gcode.c\) to use bitfields structs instead of bitfield variables.  
Done to improve readability and for easier debugging.  
Note that this is a major change and there is a non-zero risk that mistakes has been made.
* Changed signature of user mcode validation function to use a bitfield union for value words available.  
Removed the need for user mcode parameter words to have an associated value. This means that [user mcode](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/tree/test/templates) implementations now must check this locally.  
If no associated value is provided the corresponding value in the value struct is set to `NAN` (Not A Number) for floats and all bits set to 1 for integers.
* Refactored Trinamic driver code, added initial support for TMC2209. Work in progress.
* Removed the need to copy the core grbl and plugin code to the driver chosen, this is now kept in sync with the master Subversion repository automatically.
* Added initial support for RADDS 1.6 board to SAM3X8E driver \(Arduino Due\). Untested!
* Added C-axis support to iMXRT1062 driver \(Teensy 4.x\).  
Untested and none of the current board maps has the needed pins defined.
* Added alarm and error message for power on self-test \(POS\) failure.  
If POS fails only $-commands are accepted.
* Work in good progress for Trinamic TMC2209 driver support \(UART mode\).  
Processor/board specific driver code has to be added for this, currently testing with STM32F446 and Nucleo-64 breakout board.
* Renumbered setting groups for more logical sorting (by id).
* Harmonized probing code across drivers for planned future extensions.
* Added additional I/O support for the [Teensy 4.1 T41U5XBB board](https://github.com/phil-barrett/grbl-teensy-4) \(iMXRT1062 driver\), 3 outputs and 4 inputs available via `M62` - `M66`.  
Not that the result from reading inputs with `M66` cannot be used in a gcode program in any meaningful way.
* Fixed excessive step pulse jitter in STM32F4xx driver.
* Added [more options](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Report-extensions#controller-information-extensions) to the `NEWOPT` tag in the extended `$I` report.
* Error 7 is no longer issued on startup if non-volatile storage \(Flash/EEPROM/FRAM\) for settings is not available.
* [Alarm substate](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Report-extensions#realtime-report) \(if available\) is always added to the real-time report if a [complete report](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/For-sender-developers#single-character-real-time-commands) is requested by sending `0x87`.
* Added input signal and handling for limit switches override.  
The pin is pulled high and requires a normally open \(NO\) push switch for operation. When closed limit pins are excluded from the status report and alarm 12 will not be raised if a limit switch is asserted _on a soft reset_ when "Hard limits" and "Strict mode" is enabled with `$21`.
This allows normal operation so that a manual pull-off can be done before e.g. homing the machine.  
Currently only the iMXRT1062 \(Teensy 4.x\) driver has support for this, for now by reassigning the safety door input when this is not used for its intended purpose.  
__NOTE:__ A override will _not_ affect handling of homing and limit switch events elsewhere.
* Now adds `ODO` to `NEWOPT` tag values if odometer data is available.
* Updated _[my_plugin.c](templates/my_plugin.c)_ [template](templates/README.md) with settings details for `$HELP` and `$ES`/`$EG` enumerations.
* Settings/setting groups handling enhanced, moved some to plugins and added sorting (requires enough heap).
* Removed external dependencies by adding driver source/USB blob to LPC176x driver.
* Enhanced and improved ModBus support code for VFD spindle, added settings for baud rate and receive timeout.
* Added support for enumeration of and help for driver and plugin provided settings and setting groups.
* Moved board selection etc. to [CMakeLists.txt](drivers/ESP32/CMakeLists.txt) for [ESP32 driver](drivers/ESP32/README.md) for simpler configuration.
* Fixed regression for VFD spindle code, should now be able to run tests.
* Added build configurations for processor variants and Nucleo-64 boards for the [STM32F4xx driver](drivers/STM32F4xx/README.md).
* Added initial board map file for [BTT SKR 1.4 Turbo board](https://www.bigtree-tech.com/products/btt-skr-v1-4-skr-v1-4-turbo-32-bit-control-board.html) to the [LPC176x driver](drivers/LPC1769/README.md) including build configuration for bootloader compatible executable.
* Added polling of limit switches to the LPC176x driver, enabling hard limits is now possible.
* Added `$` commands for getting details about alarm codes, error codes, settings and settings groups.  
`$EA` - enumerate alarm codes.  
`$EE` - enumerate error codes.  
`$ES` - enumerate settings.  
`$EG` - enumerate setting groups.  
`$E*` - enumerate all above.  
The output from these is intended for sender developers and can be used instead of loading this information from .csv files.  
The settings enumeration contains additional information such as group assignment, datatype and format, value list for bitfields, min allowed value and max allowed value. 
For now descriptions of the settings are not included.  
__NOTE:__ This is a preview version, format and group codes may change for settings and setting groups.
* Added `$HELP` command and `$$<n>` command for listing information about a specific setting.  
`$HELP` on its own prints arguments that can be used with `$HELP`.  
`$HELP Commands` - print `$` commands available with a short description.  
`$HELP Settings` - print information about all available settings.  
`$HELP <argument>` print information about settings from the setting group provided in `<argument>`. E.g. `$HELP Spindle` will print information about spindle settings.  
__NOTE:__ do _NOT_ issue these commands from a sender MDI as the output may crash it, output is in plaintext and thus intended for use from a terminal only.
__NOTE:__ Settings data format has been changed and settings will be reset to default on update. Backup and restore.
* Moved `#define` values to settings for auto square failure distances:  
`$347` - default value from `DUAL_AXIS_HOMING_FAIL_AXIS_LENGTH_PERCENT` \(5%\) in grbl/config.h.  
`$348` - default value from `DUAL_AXIS_HOMING_FAIL_DISTANCE_MIN` \(2.5mm\) in grbl/config.h.  
`$349` - default value from `DUAL_AXIS_HOMING_FAIL_DISTANCE_MAX` \(25mm\) in grbl/config.h.
* Added settings and functionality for moving the second axis up to &plusmn;2mm after successful auto squaring to compensate for any switch alignment error.  
The settings is per axis, `$17n` where `n` is the axis index: `n` = `0` -> X axis, `1` -> Y axis, ...  
Note that settings values will only be reported for axes with dual motors installed and configured for auto squaring. 
* Added setting `$345` for pull-off rate from tool length sensor used for tool change. Default value is 100mm/min.
* Added setting flag to `$10` for enabling override of _Homing on startup required_ \(if enabled\) by a soft reset.
* Blocked loophole where machine could be unlocked by issuing a single axis homing command when _Homing on startup required_ is enabled.  
Alarm 11 will now be reissued until all axes configured for homing are homed.
* Added software debounce for the safety door switch to STM32 drivers.
* "Hardened" parking functionality. It should now tolerate a bouncy door switch and multiple closing/reopenings of the door during retract/restore.  
__NOTE:__ Not extensively tested. Use with care!
* Added `$I+` system command. This can be used when [compatibility level](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Compatibility-level) is > 0 to get the extended version including the current compatibility setting.
* Added basic support for separating limit switches from homing switches in the core. If a driver does not handle separate inputs for these the core "connects" the homing switches to the limit switches in code.
* Improved auto squaring. If a limit switch is engaged when homing starts the axis will be moved pull-off distance * 5 away from them. If still engaged homing will fail.  
__NOTE:__ Auto squaring is currently only tested with a simulator. Use with care!

---

Build 20201103:

* Added data structures for spindle encoder/spindle sync to the core. Used by drivers supporting spindle sync.
* Updated spindle sync code for MSP432 and added spindle sync capability to iMXRT1060 and STM32F4xx drivers.  
__NOTE:__ Spindle sync support is still in alpha stage! The current code has only been tested with a simulator.
* Fixed bug that could lead to settings storage area fail to reinitialize properly when corrupted.
* Moved some symbols in preparation for adding $-settings for them.
* Improved rewind capability (on `M2`) of SD card plugin. Added `$` command for dumping SD card file contents to output stream.

---

Build 20201020:

__NOTE:__ Settings data format has been changed and settings will be reset to default on update. Backup and restore.

* Added support for STM32F446 based Nucleo-64 boards to STM32F4xx driver.
* Fix for regression that set laser mode as default - `$32=1`. Check that this is correct after restoring settings from backup. 
* Added new settings option `$341=4` for ignoring `M6` tool change command.
* Bug fix for `M61Q0` - returned error previously.
* Changed clearing of tool length offset reference on homing to be done only if relevant axis is/axes are homed.
* Fixed check for running startup scripts on homing to check that all axes configured for homing are actually homed.
* Changes to message display from `(MSG,..)` comments in gcode.  
`(MSG,..)` strings will be sent back to the sender in sync with gcode execution.
* Added `*` prefix to NVS storage type in `$I` report if buffered, e.g: `[NEWOPT:*EEPROM,ES,TC]`
* Increased heap allocation for nearly all drivers.  
Memory from heap is used for the NVS buffer and for temporary storage of `(MSG,..)` strings.  
* Added option for adding substates to the `Run` state in the real time report to `$11` setting \(bit 11\).  
If enabled `Run:2` will be reported when a probing motion is ongoing, this can be used by senders to provide a simple probe protection scheme.  
* Another refactoring of the settings subsystem, this time for handling plugin settings.
Plugins settings storage space is now dynamically allocated and handled locally by the plugin code, this allows user defined plugins to add settings too!
Ten setting codes are reserved for user defined plugins.
* Added template for [basic plugin with two settings](templates/README.md).
* HAL pointers refactored for code readability, many moved to separate structures for each subsystem. Added typedefs.
* Some minor bug fixes and other code readability improvements. Prepared for switch to 16-bit CRC for settings data validation.

---

Build 20200923:

* Added support for STM32F411 based Blackpill boards to STM32F4xx driver.
* Initial changes to ESP32 driver to allow compilation with PlatformIO, added my_machine.h for this. Note that my_machine.h is not used if compiling with idf.py.
* Added home position to `$#` ngc report, e.g. `[HOME,0.000,0.000,0.000:7]` - means all axes are homed. Position is reported in machine coordinates. `:7` in the example is an axis bitfield, the reported value is for which axes are homed: bit 0 is Z, 1 is X etc. `:0` = no axes homed.
* "Hardened" the new tool change functionality even more. Initial changes for multi-axis tool reference offset made.  
An empty message will now be sent when tool change is complete, this to clear any tool change related message in the sender.
* Added call to [weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol) `my_plugin_init()` function at startup, name your [plugin](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/tree/master/plugins) init function `void my_plugin_init (void)` and there is no need to change any grblHAL source files to bring it alive.  
Use this feature for your private plugin only, multiple public plugins using this name cannot coexist!
* Some changes to improve code readability and added strict check for `G59.x` gcodes.

---

Build 20200911:

* Core refactored for better support for non-volatile storage. Some HAL entry points renamed for readability and moved to a new data structure.
* Added plugin for axis odometers. This logs total distance traveled and machining time to EEPROM/FRAM.  
[FRAM](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/semiconductor-ic-memory/fram-ferroelectric-ram-memory.php) is recommended for storage as it is faster and can sustain a larger number of write cycles. FRAM chips are sold in packages that is pin compatible with EEPROM.  
__NOTE:__ Currently for review and for now only for the iMRXT1061 \(Teensy 4.x\) driver. It will _not_ be available in configurations that stores non-volatile data to flash.
* "Hardening" of new [manual tool change](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Manual,-semi-automatic-and-automatic-tool-change) functionality. 
* Improved auto squaring algorithm in core.
* Enhanced some plugins so they can coexist.

--- 

Build 20200830:

* Improved tool change functionality, a status report is forced on end of tool change to inform change is completed.
* Fix for iMRXT1062 homing failure when serial over USB is used.
* Standardized serial over USB `#define` macro across drivers to `USB_SERIAL_CDC`.

---

Build 20200818:

* Part two of large overhaul of configuration system.

Driver configuration has been moved from _driver.h_ to _my_machine.h_ and options has been made available to be defined as compiler defined symbols/macros with the `-D` compiler command line option. In order to allow compiler defined symbols to override _my_machine.h_ settings the symbol `OVERRIDE_MY_MACHINE` should always be added to the command line. See [compiling grblHAL](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Compiling-GrblHAL) for more information. Available driver options in _my_machine.h_ can now be listed from the driver ReadMe page.

---

Build 20200813:

* "Hardened" step pulse generation when delay is enabled. The delay will now only be added on direction changes.
The minimum possible delay is dependent on many factors and will be adjusted to match what the processor is capable of.
By default driver code is calibrated for a 2.5 &micro;s delay and may deviate a bit for other settings and configurations. The actual delay should be checked with an oscilloscope when high step rates are used.
__NOTE:__ A delay is only added if AMASS is disabled, when AMASS is enabled \(it is by default\) there is always a implicit delay on direction changes.

---

Build 20200811:

* Part one of large overhaul of configuration system.
This has been done to allow a global configuration file and/or setting compile time options as compiler symbols/macros with the `-D` compiler command line option.
* Networking \(cabled ethernet\), SD Card and I2C keypad plugin support added to [Teensy 4.x driver.](drivers/IMXRT1062) A Teensy 4.1 is required for networking.
* Tool number range changed from 8-bit \(0-255\) to 32-bit \(0-4294967294\). Note that if the optional tool table is enabled the max tool number is limited by number of entries in the tool table.
* M60 and corresponding pallet shuttle HAL entry point added. No driver support for this yet.

_Configuration system changes:_

Symbols \(#define macros\) that are unlikely to be changed or is used for conditional compilation has been moved from [grbl/config.h](grbl/config.h) to [grbl/grbl.h](grbl/grbl.h).
Symbols used for conditional compilation can be overridden by `-D` compiler command line options or by editing [grbl/config.h](grbl/config.h).

[grbl/defaults.h](grbl/defaults.h) is now used for default values for settings that can be changed at run-time with the `$$` command. __Important:__ grbl/defaults.h should only be changed when adding new settings.

[grbl/config.h](grbl/config.h) is now used for overriding default values in grbl/grbl.h or grbl/defaults.h. Out of the box all overridable symbols are commented out, uncomment and change as needed to override default definitions in grbl/grbl.h or grbl/defaults.h.

These changes are part of a long term plan to create a user friendly front end for configuring and building grblHAL.

Build 20200805:
* **Important:** settings has been changed again and settings will be restored to defaults after updating. Backup & restore!
* Added tool change handler for [manual tool change](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Manual,-semi-automatic-and-automatic-tool-change) on M6. Four different modes available, selectable with [`$341` setting](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Additional-or-extended-settings#manual-tool-change-settings).
* STMF4xx driver updated for optional I2C EEPROM plugin support.

---

Build 20200722:
* **Important:** settings version has been changed again and settings will be restored to defaults after updating. Backup & restore! 
* Changed step pulse width and delay settings from int to float and reduced minimum allowed value to 2 microseconds<sup>1</sup>. Useful for very high step rates.
* New plugin for [quadrature encoder input](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/issues/73#issuecomment-659222664) for up to 5 encoders \(driver dependent\). Can be used to adjust overrides and has rudimentary support for MPG functionality. Work in progress and the iMXRT1062 \(Teensy 4\) driver is currently the only driver with low-level support for this (one encoder).
* New plugin for [ModBus VFD](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/issues/68) spindle controllers. Untested and with limited driver support in this build.
* Added setting, `$340` for spindle at speed tolerance \(percent\). If spindle fails to reach speed within limits in 4 seconds alarm 14 will be raised. Set to 0 to disable. Availability driver dependent.
* All [new settings](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Additional-or-extended-settings) are now possibly to set independent of the [compatibility level](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki/Changes-from-grbl-1.1#workaround) except some settings that has flags added to them. The added flags will not be available at all compatibility levels. A new command, `$+`, can be used to list all settings independent of compatibility level.
* Internal changes to settings data in order to simplify automatic migration on changes. Automatic migration is on the roadmap.

<sup>1</sup> Note that several factors may affect the accuracy of these settings such as step output mode, number of axes defined and compiler optimization settings.
A new #define, `STEP_PULSE_LATENCY`, has been added to driver.h for those drivers that requires it so that fine tuning can be done. I may move this to a setting later.
In setups where very high step rates are used the actual step pulse width should be confirmed with an oscilloscope.

The step pulse delay has not been fine tuned yet as setting this to a value > 0 is not normally needed as there seems to be a implicit delay on direction changes when AMASS is enabled.

__Note:__ high step rates \(e.g. above 80 kHz\) cannot be achieved with the step pulse setting set to the default 10 microseconds. This has to be reduced so that both the on and off time is within specifications of the stepper driver. At 100 kHz the time available for a pulse \(on + off\) is 10 microseconds.

__Note:__ The SAMD21 \(MKRZERO\) driver needs updating in for it to allow short step pulses. My mistake was to use some Arduino code so that the Arduino pin numbers could be used for pin mappings. This adds around 500 ns per axis of overhead... To be fixed later.

For the curious: I have managed to achieve a 400 kHz step rate with the iMXRT1062 before everything breaks down, this with a command entered from MDI. I have not tested this with a running program, but I am pretty sure that a step rate at or above 200 kHz is sustainable.

2020/06/18: Added driver for STM32F4xx [Black Pill](https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/12/24/stm32-black-pill-board-features-stm32f4-cortex-m4-mcu-optional-spi-flash/), code modified by @shaise from the STM32F1xx driver. This is the first driver provided by someone else than me, thanks for that.

This driver is a candidate along with the IMXRT1062 \(Teensy 4.x\) driver to get spindle sync support. I have a [NucleoF411RE development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f411re.html) on order and will look into adding a pin mapping for that when it arrives.

Build 20200603:
* **Important:** settings version has been changed and settings will be restored to defaults after updating. Backup & restore! 
* Optimizations for ring buffer handling in planner and step generator.
* New optional input signal for probe connected status, driver support will be added later to selected drivers.
* Automatic reporting of tool length offset \(`[TLO:...]`\) when changed.
* Support for [G5](http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/2.5/html/gcode/gcode.html#sec:G5-Cubic-Spline) \(cubic spline\) added.
* `G43.x`, `G49` and `G92` added to parser state report.
* `G76` [threading cycle](https://hackaday.io/project/165248-mini-lathe-emco-compact-5-cnc-conversion) refactored.
* \(Re\)added `REPORT_PROBE_COORDINATES` and `TOOL_LENGTH_OFFSET_AXIS` [configuration](grbl/config.h) options, the latter available when `COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL` > 2.
* Improved backwards compatibility with vanilla grbl, e.g. G92 and tool offset\(s\) will be lost on a soft reset. Dependent on `COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL` setting.
* Board name added to `$I` report if provided by driver.
* [Grbl-Sim](https://github.com/grbl/grbl-sim) ported to grblHAL as a [driver](drivers/Simulator). Added telnet support++. Can be used to test senders. Note: currently only compiled/tested for Linux.
* Some minor bug fixes.

Build 20200503: Added configuration flag for manual homing. \(Re\)added compile time option `ENABLE_SAFETY_DOOR_INPUT_PIN` for [safety door switch](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/blob/master/grbl/config.h), default is now disabled. Some bug fixes and "hardening" of code.

---

Added some [template code](./templates/README.md) to aid customizations such as driver support for M62 - M68 M-codes mentioned below.

---

Build 20191222: Added digital and analog output support to the core \(and HAL\) as per [linuxcnc specifications for M62 - M68](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/m-code.html#mcode:m62-m65), number of outputs available \(if any\) is driver dependent. Adding support for these M-commands makes it fairly easy to add driver code \(for up to 256 outputs\) as parsing and synchronization is taken care of by the core.

---

Build 20191215: Moved spindle RPM linearization to $-settings, option needs to be enabled in config.h - driver support required. Optimized EEPROM allocation handling. WebUI support for ESP32 driver improved.  

MSP432 driver enhanced for spindle linearization app in the pipeline \(for Windows only - needs input from spindle encoder\), more work done on closed loop spindle RPM control and spindle synchronized motion - still at experimental stage.

__NOTE:__ settings version number has been increased so settings will be reset to default after update, make a backup first!

---

Added [#define COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL to config.h](grbl/config.h) for backwards compatibility with Grbl v1.1 protocol definition, this for enabling the use of more GCode senders. Please raise an issue if your sender still does not behave well after setting this as the current implementation does not yet disable all extensions, notably [new $xx settings](doc/markdown/grblHAL%20extensions.md#settings).

G76 threading support added to grblHAL in combination with the [MSP432 driver](drivers/MSP432/README.md). Extensive testing is required before it can be regarded as safe.

**WARNING!** This is a potentially dangerous addition. Do NOT use if you do not understand the risks. A proper E-Stop is a must, it should cut power to the steppers and if possible engage any spindle brake. The implementation is based on the [linuxcnc specification](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.6/html/gcode/gcode.html#sec:G76-Threading-Canned). Please note that I am not a machinist so my interpretation and implementation may be wrong!

G76 availability requires a spindle encoder with index pulse, grblHAL configured to [lathe mode](doc/markdown/settings.md#opmode) and tuning of the spindle sync PID loop.  
__NOTE:__ Feed hold is delayed until spindle synced cut is complete, spindle RPM overrides and CSS mode disabled through the whole cycle.
