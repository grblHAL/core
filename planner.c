  Recalculates the motion plan according to the following basic guidelines:

    1. Go over every feasible block sequentially in reverse order and calculate the junction speeds
        (i.e. current->entry_speed) such that:
      a. No junction speed exceeds the pre-computed maximum junction speed limit or nominal speeds of
         neighboring blocks.
      b. A block entry speed cannot exceed one reverse-computed from its exit speed (next->entry_speed)
         with a maximum allowable deceleration over the block travel distance.
      c. The last (or newest appended) block is planned from a complete stop (an exit speed of zero).
    2. Go over every block in chronological (forward) order and dial down junction speed values if
      a. The exit speed exceeds the one forward-computed from its entry speed with the maximum allowable
         acceleration over the block travel distance.

  When these stages are complete, the planner will have maximized the velocity profiles throughout the all
  of the planner blocks, where every block is operating at its maximum allowable acceleration limits. In
  other words, for all of the blocks in the planner, the plan is optimal and no further speed improvements
  are possible. If a new block is added to the buffer, the plan is recomputed according to the said
  guidelines for a new optimal plan.

  To increase computational efficiency of these guidelines, a set of planner block pointers have been
  created to indicate stop-compute points for when the planner guidelines cannot logically make any further
  changes or improvements to the plan when in normal operation and new blocks are streamed and added to the
  planner buffer. For example, if a subset of sequential blocks in the planner have been planned and are
  bracketed by junction velocities at their maximums (or by the first planner block as well), no new block
  added to the planner buffer will alter the velocity profiles within them. So we no longer have to compute
  them. Or, if a set of sequential blocks from the first block in the planner (or a optimal stop-compute
  point) are all accelerating, they are all optimal and can not be altered by a new block added to the
  planner buffer, as this will only further increase the plan speed to chronological blocks until a maximum
  junction velocity is reached. However, if the operational conditions of the plan changes from infrequently
  used feed holds or feedrate overrides, the stop-compute pointers will be reset and the entire plan is
  recomputed as stated in the general guidelines.

  Planner buffer pointer mapping:
  - block_buffer_tail: Points to the beginning of the planner buffer. First to be executed or being executed.
  - block_buffer_head: Points to the buffer block after the last block in the buffer. Used to indicate whether
      the buffer is full or empty. As described for standard ring buffers, this block is always empty.
  - next_buffer_head: Points to next planner buffer block after the buffer head block. When equal to the
      buffer tail, this indicates the buffer is full.
  - block_buffer_planned: Points to the first buffer block after the last optimally planned block for normal
      streaming operating conditions. Use for planning optimizations by avoiding recomputing parts of the
      planner buffer that don't change with the addition of a new block, as describe above. In addition,
      this block can never be less than block_buffer_tail and will always be pushed forward and maintain
      this requirement when encountered by the plan_discard_current_block() routine during a cycle.

  NOTE: Since the planner only computes on what's in the planner buffer, some motions with lots of short
  line segments, like G2/3 arcs or complex curves, may seem to move slow. This is because there simply isn't
  enough combined distance traveled in the entire buffer to accelerate up to the nominal speed and then
  decelerate to a complete stop at the end of the buffer, as stated by the guidelines. If this happens and
  becomes an annoyance, there are a few simple solutions: (1) Maximize the machine acceleration. The planner
  will be able to compute higher velocity profiles within the same combined distance. (2) Maximize line
  motion(s) distance per block to a desired tolerance. The more combined distance the planner has to use,
  the faster it can go. (3) Maximize the planner buffer size. This also will increase the combined distance
  for the planner to compute over. It also increases the number of computations the planner has to perform
  to compute an optimal plan, so select carefully. ARM versions should have enough memory and speed for
  look-ahead blocks numbering up to a hundred or more.

/* Add a new linear movement to the buffer. target[N_AXIS] is the signed, absolute target position
   in millimeters. Feed rate specifies the speed of the motion. If feed rate is inverted, the feed
   rate is taken to mean "frequency" and would complete the operation in 1/feed_rate minutes.
   All position data passed to the planner must be in terms of machine position to keep the planner
   independent of any coordinate system changes and offsets, which are handled by the g-code parser.
   NOTE: Assumes buffer is available. Buffer checks are handled at a higher level by motion_control.
   In other words, the buffer head is never equal to the buffer tail.  Also the feed rate input value
   is used in three ways: as a normal feed rate if invert_feed_rate is false, as inverse time if
   invert_feed_rate is true, or as seek/rapids rate if the feed_rate value is negative (and
   invert_feed_rate always false).
   The system motion condition tells the planner to plan a motion in the always unused block buffer
   head. It avoids changing the planner state and preserves the buffer to ensure subsequent gcode
   motions are still planned correctly, while the stepper module only points to the block buffer head
